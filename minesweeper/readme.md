this is a minesweeper game that I built in p5.js

web editor: https://editor.p5js.org/arnavg472/sketches/nWB8id7nL

controls:
  flag: 'k' key while mouse is hovering over the tile
  clear: click the tile with the mouse
features:


  the tiles are randomly generated with a pre-specified number of mines and the player's first click will always be an empty tile
